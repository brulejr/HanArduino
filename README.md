# HanArduino

Based upon the Arduino hardware, HanArduino provides control of various home automation eqipment through a message-based, RESTful web service. 

This project is broken into three distict parts:

* han_coordinator: the Arduino controller node that manages RESTful access and controls remote nodes through wireless messaging
* han_remote_control: a preliminary Arduino remote node that manages a bank of eight relays for controlling irrigation valves
* HanMessenger: a shared library based upon CmdMessenger that coordinates messaging between the controller and remote nodes of the wireless network
